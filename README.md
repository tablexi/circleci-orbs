# circleci-orbs

A collection of standard Table XI CircleCI jobs/commands

## What do these orbs provide

By including the tablexi/standard orb, you can use the common jobs/commands which are in use in many of our projects.

By using orbs, any improvements/learnings which we make on one project, can be more easily distributed to the other projects by way of upgrading the orb definition, and incrementing the in-use orb version on the various projects.

These orbs provide the following Jobs:

- check_db_schema: check to ensure that we can migrate from scratch and end up with the schema.rb
- rubocop: run the rubocop command
- bundle_audit: run the bundle-audit command
- haml_lint: run the haml-lint command
- rspec: Run Rspec after waiting for db and loading schema
- teaspoon: Run teaspoon after waiting for db and loading schema

These orbs provide the following commands:

- wait_for_other_builds: Ensure no earlier numbered job (of this branch) is running
- wait_for_db: Wait for the database to be ready to accept connections
- load_db_schema: Load the database schema, no matter the db type
- prepare_database: Perform wait_for_db, create the db, and load_db_schema steps as one command

## Using these orbs

To use these orbs, you first need to declare the orbs:
```yaml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  tablexi: tablexi/standard@0.0.3
```

You also must enable "Build Processing" within the CircleCI "Advanced Settings" tab.

Then you can specify the individual steps within your workflows:
```yaml
workflows:
  version: 2
  build_test_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - tablexi/rspec:
          executor:
            name: my_executor
          requires:
            - build
      - tablexi/rubocop:
          executor:
            name: my_executor
          requires:
            - build
      - release_stage:
          requires:
            - tablexi/rspec
            - tablexi/rubocop
          filters:
            only:
              - develop
```

## Using a Mysql Database

The rspec and check_db_schema jobs by default wait for a postgres db to be available.
If you are running on a mysql database, pass the `mysql_db_type: true` parameter.

E.g.
```
- tablexi/check_db_schema:
    executor:
      name: my_executor
    mysql_db_type: true
    requires:
      - build
```

## Adjusting parallelism

The rspec job runs with parallelism 1 by default.
If you want to increase the parallelism, you can set it as a parameter.
E.g.

```
- tablexi/rspec:
    executor:
      name: my_executor
    mysql_db_type: true
    parallelism: 4
    requires:
      - build
```

## Validating your configuration.

If you install the `circleci` commandline tool, you can validate that your usage of the orbs is correct, without having to upload the file to CircleCI.

```
circleci config validate .circleci/config.yml
```

## Using the `wait_for_other_builds` command

The `wait_for_other_builds` command can be used in order to ensure that there are no earlier builds running in CI when this build is running.

This can help deal with resource constraints such as deploying to a common server.

In order to accomplish this, the `wait_for_other_builds` command uses the CircleCI API in order to see whether any lower-numbered jobs are executing on this branch.

To do this, you must first specify a `CIRCLE_TOKEN` in the project's Environment Variables, and set this to an "API Key" ("Build Artifact" access is required) that you have created in the Circle CI UI.

### Example use of `wait_for_other_builds`

```
release_stage:
  executor: my_executor
  steps:
    - attach_workspace:
        at: ~/tmp

    - tablexi/wait_for_other_builds

    - run: bundle exec cap stage deploy
```

### Troubleshooting common errors

If you have an error like

```jq: error (at <stdin>:0): Cannot index string with string "build_num"```

You probably need to recreate your `CIRCLE_TOKEN` API token.

Be sure that it's set with the correct permissions.

## Upgrade Guide

If you are upgrading from an existing CircleCI 2.0 config file, these are some of the steps that you'll want to take:

1. Enable "Build Processing" within the CircleCI "Advanced Settings" tab.
1. Replace your `references` with executors
  - Old Style:
```
references:
  default_job_config: &default_job_config
    # The working directory is important, so that we
    # install/cache everything relative to that location
    working_directory: ~/tmp
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.3.7-node-browsers-legacy
        environment:
          RAILS_ENV: test
          # Bundle paths are necessary so that the gems are installed within the workspace
          # otherwise, they are installed in /usr/local
          BUNDLE_PATH: ~/tmp/vendor/bundle
          BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG: ~/tmp/vendor/bundle
jobs:
  build:
    <<: *default_job_config
    steps:
      - checkout
```
  - New Style:
```
executors:
  my_executor:
    # The working directory is important, so that we
    # install/cache everything relative to that location
    working_directory: ~/tmp
    docker:
      - image: circleci/ruby:2.3.7-node-browsers-legacy
        environment:
          RAILS_ENV: test
          # Bundle paths are necessary so that the gems are installed within the workspace
          # otherwise, they are installed in /usr/local
          BUNDLE_PATH: ~/tmp/vendor/bundle
          BUNDLE_APP_CONFIG: ~/tmp/vendor/bundle
jobs:
  build:
    executor: my_executor
    steps:
      - checkout
```

1. Replace existing rspec/rubocop/etc jobs with tablexi/circleci-orbs jobs
  - Old Style:
```
workflows:
  version: 2
  build_test_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - rspec:
          requires:
            - build
      - release_stage:
          requires:
            - rspec
          filters:
            branches:
              only:
                - develop
```
  - New Style:
```
workflows:
  version: 2
  build_test_deploy:
    jobs:
      - build
      - tablexi/rspec: # NOTE
          executor:
            name: my_executor
          mysql_db_type: true
          requires:
            - build
      - release_stage:
          requires:
            - tablexi/rspec # NOTE
          filters:
            branches:
              only:
                - develop
```

1. Replace existing `shell` references with `run` references:
  - Old Style:
```
      - type: shell
        command: |
          bundle exec rspec --profile 10
```
  - New Style: **Note**: The indentation of `command` and command lines are also changed.
```
      - run:
          command: |
            bundle exec rspec --profile 10
```

1. Validate that your changes are valid. (optional step)

```
circleci config validate .circleci/config.yml
```

## Developing updates for this gem

To push the current code into the `dev` version online:

`circleci orb publish src/standard.yml tablexi/standard@dev:first`

## Publishing new versions of the orbs

The `circleci` command-line tool is used to publish versions of the orbs.

All Table XI members can publish development versions of the orbs.

To publish production-versions of the orbs, you must be a TXI Admin.

For more details: https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/config-preview-sdk/blob/master/docs/orbs-authoring.md

Command to publish the current `dev` version:

`circleci orb publish promote tablexi/standard@dev:first patch`
